{"name":"Phpbb-wap v4 lts","tagline":"中文phpBB-WAP v5仍在缓慢地开发中，但针对v4的一些问题，基本上处于无人维护的境地，在此，特别开一个项目，来解决爱疯的云 的v4在生产上遇到的问题。LTS是 Long-Term Support的意思，这个版本的更新会持续到v5正式发布以后。另外一个版本RE主要是我理想中的下一个版本的phpBB-WAP的样子，但不能理解为另一个v5，也许可以算是v5的实验室呢~","body":"## 目的 ##\r\n建立phpBB-WAP v4 LTS的github pages，主要是准备想一个用于发布LTS和RE版本的发布站，仅此而已。\r\n\r\n## 以下内容请忽略 ##\r\n\r\n### Welcome to GitHub Pages.\r\nThis automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here using GitHub Flavored Markdown, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new branch:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out the documentation at http://help.github.com/pages or contact support@github.com and we’ll help you sort it out.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
